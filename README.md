## Description
As my hobby om mine, i do lots of stuff related to older mitsubishi cars, and ECUs.
This is my attempt to make my life easier while performing diagnostics on older (1988 - 1994) mitsubishi ecus.

My goal is to create diagnostic bench for those ECUs, and as a part of this project is to create device that is stand alone and have ability to check if ecu is performing as expected (is able to communicate and reads all data from sensors).
